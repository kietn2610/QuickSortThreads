# QuickSortThreads

Create a C++ project that takes in 1 million unsorted numbers from numbers.txt and turn it into an array. Then split the array into 8 sections correspond with 8 threadsâ€“ each section will have 125,000 numbers. 
Sorting time was reduced down to below 1 second which beat Linux default sorting.
